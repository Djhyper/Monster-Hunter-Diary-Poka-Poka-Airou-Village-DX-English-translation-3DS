Welcome to the **Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airu Village Translation Project**! 
This project aims to translate the in-game dialogue from Japanese to English to make the game more accessible to non-Japanese speakers.

## Project Overview
**Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airu Village** (モンハン日記 ぽかぽかアイルー村) is a charming spin-off of the popular Monster Hunter series. 
My goal is to provide accurate and contextual translations of all in-game dialogue.

## How to Install
1. You need to own a copy of the game and extract the `.3ds` or `.CIA` file.
2. Download the main branch of this repository.
3. Replace the original files with the downloaded translated files.
4. Recompile the files back into the `.3ds` or `.CIA` file format.

## Progress & Bugs
The translation V1.0 is **98% fully translated**. Due to game engine limitations, the text formatting will sometimes not fit into the respective dialogue boxes.

**If you see any non-translated text or other issues, please refer to the [How to Contribute | Help](#how-to-contribute--help) section.**

**There are still many formatting issues that will be worked on. For now, you can finish the full game in English with no problems.** 
**In very rare cases, some NPCs cannot be talked to. This is due to an issue with the translation. Please let me know if you find any such cases.**

## English Wiki & Item Names
*Coming soon*

## How to Contribute | Help
The translation is almost complete, but some text cannot be translated easily with simple text editing due to the game engine.

If you have knowledge in **Assembly** and/or **Dark Souls modding** (especially .param files), please don't hesitate to join this project and try your luck!

**Community Discord: Coming soon**

In the community Discord, you can see all issues that I am currently having if you want to help out and contribute.
